# üåø Plant Classifier Model

A simple deep learning model built with **TensorFlow** to classify plant species based on input images. This project demonstrates the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks and is trained on a dataset sourced from **Kaggle**.


## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omrathod2003/140-most-popular-crops-image-dataset?resource=download-directory&select=140_crops_list.txt)) and includes labeled images of various plant species. Each image is categorized under a specific plant class.

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

The plant classifier model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow's Keras `Sequential` API. It consists of the following layers:

1. **Conv2D Layer**  
   - 32 filters  
   - Kernel size: 3x3  
   - Activation: ReLU  
   - Input shape: `(224, 224, 3)` (RGB images resized to 224x224)

2. **MaxPooling2D Layer**  
   - Pool size: 2x2 (reduces spatial dimensions)

3. **Conv2D Layer**  
   - 64 filters  
   - Kernel size: 3x3  
   - Activation: ReLU

4. **MaxPooling2D Layer**  
   - Pool size: 2x2

5. **Flatten Layer**  
   - Flattens 2D feature maps into 1D vector

6. **Dense Layer**  
   - 128 units  
   - Activation: ReLU

7. **Output Dense Layer**  
   - Number of units equals the number of plant classes (`train_data.num_classes`)  
   - Activation: Softmax (for multi-class classification)

### Model Compilation

- **Optimizer:** Adam  
- **Loss function:** Categorical Crossentropy
